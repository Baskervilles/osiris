What's this dir about?
======================

This directory contains scripts that are integrated in llvm-apps clientctl
interface, but are currently somewhat Minix specific. Examples for such scripts
are the blobification and fusing of minix.  Whenever we extend this to othter
application they should be adapted to be more generic and moved into the
apps/scripts directory.
